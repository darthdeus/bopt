# This file is a template for a new experiment.
# It specifies how the experiment is to be created,
# but does not hold its state.

# Name of the experiment
name: EXPERIMENT_NAME

# Directory where the results are being stored.
# By default this is RELATIVE to the directory
# where this configuration file is stored.
#
# It is also possible to specify an absolute path,
# but it should not be necessary to change this
# default in most cases.

# A List of hyperparamters to be tuned.
hyperparameters:
  # Each hyperparameter needs to specify:
  #
  #   name: string
  #   type: int/float
  #   bounds: min and max value, both int/float
  - name: gamma
    type: float
    bounds:
      min: 1e-6
      max: 1.0

  - name: epsilon
    type: float
    bounds:
      min: 1e-6
      max: 1.0

  # - name: num_layers
  #   type: int
  #   bounds:
  #     min: 1
  #     max: 10

# The runner determines which program is being optimzied.
# It can run either in local mode when jobs are executed
# on the current machine, or on SGE where each evaluation
# is submitted as a separate job.
runner:
  # So far the runner can be either "local" or "sge".

  # the intermediate and final results of a job.

  # Right now the only valid value is the default one.
