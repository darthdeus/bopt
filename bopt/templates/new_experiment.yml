# This file is a template for a new experiment.

name: EXPERIMENT_NAME

# A List of hyperparamters to be tuned.
hyperparameters:
  # Each hyperparameter needs to specify:
  #
  #   name: string
  #   type: int/float
  #   bounds: min and max value, both int/float
  - name: gamma
    type: float
    bounds:
      min: 1e-6
      max: 1.0

  - name: epsilon
    type: float
    bounds:
      min: 1e-6
      max: 1.0

  # - name: num_layers
  #   type: int
  #   bounds:
  #     min: 1
  #     max: 10

# The runner determines which program is being optimzied.
# It can run either in local mode when jobs are executed
# on the current machine, or on SGE where each evaluation
# is submitted as a separate job.
runner:
  # So far the runner can be either "local" or "sge".
  type: local

  # Module path a parser instance which can read
  # the intermediate and final results of a job.
  #
  # Right now the only valid value is the default one.
